  /**
   * The `offset` modifier can shift your popper on both its axis.
   *
   * It accepts the following units:
   * - `px` or unitless, interpreted as pixels
   * - `%` or `%r`, percentage relative to the length of the reference element
   * - `%p`, percentage relative to the length of the popper element
   * - `vw`, CSS viewport width unit
   * - `vh`, CSS viewport height unit
   *
   * For length is intended the main axis relative to the placement of the popper.<br />
   * This means that if the placement is `top` or `bottom`, the length will be the
   * `width`. In case of `left` or `right`, it will be the height.
   *
   * You can provide a single value (as `Number` or `String`), or a pair of values
   * as `String` divided by a comma or one (or more) white spaces.<br />
   * The latter is a deprecated method because it leads to confusion and will be
   * removed in v2.<br />
   * Additionally, it accepts additions and subtractions between different units.
   * Note that multiplications and divisions aren't supported.
   *
   * Valid examples are:
   * ```
   * 10
   * '10%'
   * '10, 10'
   * '10%, 10'
   * '10 + 10%'
   * '10 - 5vh + 3%'
   * '-10px + 5vh, 5px - 6%'
   * ```
   * > **NB**: If you desire to apply offsets to your poppers in a way that may make them overlap
   * > with their reference element, unfortunately, you will have to disable the `flip` modifier.
   * > More on this [reading this issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/373)
