# useCustomLogic

You can build your own custom hook to perform unique logic. There
are many widgets that can live inside a floating element (like a
datepicker), so being able to extend the library is important.

If you want to pass it into `useInteractions(){:js}`, you can
return an object with the following shape:

```js
const useCustomLogic = (context) => {
  // Both of these are optional! It's a regular hook,
  // so you can do anything you want.
  return {
    reference: {
      // React.HTMLProps
    },
    floating: {
      // React.HTMLProps
    },
  };
};
```

If you have ideas for new hooks or functionality, don't hesitate
to open a new issue or discussion on the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui) ❤️!
