# Getting Started

Floating UI is a low-level library for creating "floating"
elements like tooltips, popovers, dropdowns, menus, and more.

The library provides two key functionalities:

1. **Anchored positioning primitives**: Given a reference element
   (such as a button), anchor the floating element next to it
   while simultaneously ensuring it is positioned optimally in
   view by preventing overflow and clipping. The reference
   element may be positioned anywhere on the screen and the
   floating element will remain anchored to it without
   overflowing the viewport edges using various adjustment
   techniques called
   [middleware](https://floating-ui.com/docs/middleware).
2. **Interaction primitives**: Add accessible interactions that
   power floating elements to follow WAI-ARIA authoring
   practices, including event listeners, click outside/escape key
   dismissing, ARIA attributes, focus trapping, list navigation,
   typeahead, etc. This functionality is currently available for
   React DOM but will be made agnostic in the future.

The positioning engine features a tiny 600-byte core with strong
tree-shaking support, is extensible through custom middleware,
and can support any platform.

## Install

Choose the package that suits you.

### Vanilla DOM positioning engine

Use with vanilla JavaScript or a non-React framework
([view tutorial](/docs/tutorial)).

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/dom
```

### React DOM positioning engine

Use with React DOM ([view docs](/docs/react-dom)).

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/react-dom
```

### React DOM interactions and positioning engine

Primitive hooks and components, in addition to the positioning
engine, to use with React DOM
([view docs](/docs/react-dom-interactions)).

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/react-dom-interactions
```

### React Native positioning engine

Use with React Native ([view docs](/docs/react-native)).

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/react-native
```

### Canvas or other platforms

Learn about creating a [Platform](/docs/platform).

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/core
```

## CDN

<details>
  <summary>View details</summary>

Floating UI can be loaded via CDN using ESM or UMD format.

#### ESM

#### Import maps

When working in a low or no build context, it can be useful to
consume code with bare module specifiers, e.g.
`import * from '@floating-ui/dom';{:js}`. In order to do so,
[import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) clarify the
origin of such references for the browser.

  <details>
  <summary>JSPM import map example</summary>

```mdx
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "@floating-ui/dom": "https://ga.jspm.io/npm:@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__/dist/floating-ui.dom.esm.js"
    },
    "scopes": {
      "https://ga.jspm.io/": {
        "@floating-ui/core": "https://ga.jspm.io/npm:@floating-ui/core@__CORE_VERSION__/dist/floating-ui.core.esm.js"
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

JSPM provides a [generator](https://generator.jspm.io/) for
leveraging this API with their CDN.

</details>

#### UMD

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@floating-ui/core@__CORE_VERSION__"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__"></script>
```

All exports will be available on `window.FloatingUIDOM{:js}`.

## Package entry points

> Using webpack, Vite, or Parcel? Skip this section as modern
> bundlers handle this for you.

Floating UI uses `process.env.NODE_ENV{:js}` to determine whether
your build is in development or production mode. This allows us
to add console warnings and errors during development to help you
but ensure they get stripped out in production to keep the bundle
size small.

This causes an error in Rollup and low/no-build setups. To solve
this, Floating UI exports browser-ready ES modules. Leverage the
"browser" package export condition to use these modules.

<details>
  <summary>Rollup example</summary>

The `browser{:.objectKey}` option in the `nodeResolve(){:js}`
plugin will select browser versions of packages if available.

```js
import {nodeResolve} from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    nodeResolve({
      browser: true,

      // Add this line for development config, omit for
      // production config
      exportConditions: ['development'],
    }),
  ],
};
```
