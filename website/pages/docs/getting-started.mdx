# Getting Started

Floating UI is a low-level library for positioning "floating"
elements like tooltips, popovers, dropdowns, menus and more while
intelligently keeping them in view.

Challenges arise when positioning floating elements as they get
taken out of the normal layout flow of a document, leading to
issues with clipping and overflow, which is where this library
can help!

- **Tiny**: 600-byte core with highly modular architecture for
  tree-shaking
- **Low-level**: Granular control over positioning behavior
- **Pure**: Predictable and side-effect free
- **Extensible**: Powerful middleware system
- **Platform-agnostic**: Runs on any JavaScript environment which
  provides measurement APIs, including the web and
  [React Native](/docs/react-native)

```shell
npm install @floating-ui/dom
```

```shell
yarn add @floating-ui/dom
```

## Development and production builds

Floating UI is published with default, development, and
production builds, using Node's support for
[export conditions](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_conditional_exports).

- `"default"{:js}`: uses `process.env.NODE_ENV{:js}`, in which
  your bundler handles the env variable, dead code elimination,
  and minification
- `"production"{:js}`: minified with no debug logging
- `"development"{:js}`: unminified with debug logging

If you're using a bundler like webpack, Vite, or Parcel, this is
handled for you **automatically**.

If this is not handled, you must opt into one of the builds in
tools that support export conditions. This is done differently
for each tool.

  <summary>Rollup example</summary>

Using the `@rollup/node-resolve{:.string}` plugin, you can select
the development build with the `exportConditions{:.objectKey}`
option:

```js
import {nodeResolve} from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    nodeResolve({
      exportConditions: ['development'],
    }),
  ],
};
```

## CDN

Floating UI can be loaded via CDN using ESM or UMD format.

### ESM

[Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/) lets you load ES modules in
the browser:

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as FloatingUIDOM from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__';
</script>
```

Append `?min{:.string}` to the URL in production.

#### Import maps

When working in a low or no build context, it can be useful to
consume code with bare module specifiers, e.g.
`import * from '@floating-ui/dom';{:js}`. In order to do so,
[import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) clarify the
origin of such a references for the browser.

<details>
<summary>JSPM import map example</summary>

```mdx
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "@floating-ui/dom": "https://ga.jspm.io/npm:@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__/dist/floating-ui.dom.esm.js"
    },
    "scopes": {
      "https://ga.jspm.io/": {
        "@floating-ui/core": "https://ga.jspm.io/npm:@floating-ui/core@__CORE_VERSION__/dist/floating-ui.core.esm.js"
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

JSPM provides a [generator](https://generator.jspm.io/) for
leveraging this API with their CDN.

</details>

### UMD

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@floating-ui/core@__CORE_VERSION__"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@floating-ui/dom@__DOM_VERSION__"></script>
```

All exports will be available on `window.FloatingUIDOM{:js}`.
